Rust Toolchain for L4Re
=======================

This build the Rust compiler by taking the relevant Rust compiler components
with a few L4Re adoptions.

If you do not want the script to change your Rust environment, call:

    $ ./checkout_and_build.sh init-rust

which sets up a local Rust environment for the build and test process.

To build the toolchain, call the script like this:

    $ ./checkout_and_build.sh gen-toolchain

After this, the toolchain can be found in ``rust-l4re-toolchain`` directory,
and ``rust-l4re-toolchain.tar.xz`` file.


Testing Routine
===============

To check whether the build worked and leads to working binaries, please run
the following:

    $ ./checkout_and_build.sh hookup-toolchain
    $ ./checkout_and_build.sh build-kernel
    $ ./checkout_and_build.sh build-hello

The run it you need to have QEMU installed for the respective target
architectures.

    $ ./checkout_and_build.sh run aarch64
    $ ./checkout_and_build.sh run x86_64
